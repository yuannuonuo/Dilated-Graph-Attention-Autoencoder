# Dilated-Graph-Attention-Autoencoder

This project contains source codes for for paper "Rumor Detection with Jumping Attention: A Dilated Graph Attention Autoencoder Integrating Textual and Structural Information from User Discussion". 

The whole project is derived from  the graph attention network implemented by PetarV- through pytorch.(https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT).

Data and models presented in the paper are store on google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QBP4YkpRD2ePFDIN-Ccb3VlbgplNLLqL?usp=drive_link).

# Requirements
DGATE relies on Python>=3.5 and PyTorch>=2.1.0.

# More details will be released in the future.
