# Dilated-Graph-Attention-Autoencoder

This project contains source codes for for paper "Rumor Detection based on User Discussion: A Graph Jumping Attention Approach". 

The whole project is derived from the graph attention network implemented by PetarV- through pytorch.(https://github.com/PetarV-/GAT).

Data and models presented in the paper are stored on google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QBP4YkpRD2ePFDIN-Ccb3VlbgplNLLqL?usp=drive_link).

# Requirements
DGATE relies on Python>=3.5 and PyTorch>=2.1.0.
